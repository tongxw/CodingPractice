#Making Change
Given an integer representing a given amount of change, write a function to compute the total number of coins required to make that amount of change. You can assume that there is always a 1Â¢ coin.

eg. (assuming American coins: 1, 5, 10, and 25 cents)
makeChange(1) = 1 (1)
makeChange(6) = 2 (5 + 1)
makeChange(49) = 7 (25 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1)
